Wikipedia Cite-o-Meter (WPCoM) is a tool designed to generate statistics of citations of scholarly works in Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.
Citation data is aggregated by publishers, which are identified by DOI prefixes available from CrossRef at: http://www.crossref.org/06members/50go-live.html

WPCoM generates reports in three different formats: as charts, sortable table and raw JSON. WPCoM data is released under CC0.
